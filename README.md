## 🔍 Overview

The **DP Optimization Engine** is a Python desktop application that bridges the gap between theoretical algorithm knowledge and practical implementation understanding. It provides:

- **Step-by-step visual animation** of how dynamic programming tables are built bottom-up.
- **Traceback path highlighting** to show which choices were made to reach the optimal solution.
- **Live performance benchmarking** that plots recursive vs. tabular execution times, making the exponential-to-polynomial performance leap visually tangible.

> **Target Audience**: Computer science students, algorithms instructors, and developers exploring optimization techniques and performance tradeoffs.

## 🧮 Supported Algorithms

The toolkit implements **four classical DP algorithms**, each with three solver variants:
- **Recursive** — pure exponential solution (no caching)
- **Tabular 2D** — iterative bottom-up with full DP table
- **Space-Optimized** — reduced memory footprint using 1D arrays

---

### 1. 0/1 Knapsack

> Maximize total value of selected items subject to a weight capacity constraint.

**Input Format**: `Weights & Capacity` (e.g. `1, 2, 3 | 5`) and `Values` (e.g. `6, 10, 12`)

**Recurrence**:
```text
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], v[i-1] + dp[i-1][j - w[i-1]])   if w[i-1] <= j
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]                                        otherwise
```

---

### 2. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

> Find the longest sequence of characters present in both input strings in the same relative order.

**Input Format**: `String X` (e.g. `ABCBDAB`) and `String Y` (e.g. `BDCABA`)

**Recurrence**:
```text
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1          if X[i-1] == Y[j-1]
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])  otherwise
```

---

### 3. Coin Change (Min Coins)

> Find the minimum number of coins needed to make a target amount using an unlimited supply of given denominations.

**Input Format**: `Coin Denominations` (e.g. `1, 2, 5`) and `Target Amount` (e.g. `11`)

**Recurrence**:
```text
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], 1 + dp[i][j - c[i-1]])   if c[i-1] <= j
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]                                 otherwise
```

---

### 4. Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM)

> Find the most efficient parenthesization to multiply a chain of matrices with the fewest scalar multiplications.

**Input Format**: `Matrix Dimensions` (e.g. `40, 20, 30, 10, 30`)

**Recurrence**:
```text
dp[i][j] = min over k in [i, j): dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + p[i-1] * p[k] * p[j]
```

### Backend API Contract

All tabular solvers in `core/` return a **standardized dictionary**:

```python
{
    "length": int,      # Optimal objective value (max value, LCS length, min coins, etc.)
    "table":  2D_list,  # Full DP computation matrix
    "path":   str       # Human-readable optimal solution description
}
```

## 🚀 Usage

### GUI Mode (Default)

```bash
python main.py
```

1. **Select an algorithm** from the dropdown menu in the left sidebar.
2. **Enter your inputs** in the fields (or leave them blank to use built-in defaults).
3. **Click "Run Analysis"** — the DP table will begin animating cell-by-cell.
4. Use **Play / Pause / Step** to control the animation pace.
5. Adjust the **Speed Slider** (0.1s – 2.0s per step) for faster or slower playback.
6. After animation completes:
   - The **optimal path** is highlighted in green on the table.
   - The **solution string** appears in the reconstruction panel.
   - A **performance chart** plots recursive vs. tabular runtimes.

### CLI Mode (Console Tests)

```bash
python main.py --cli
```

Runs all four algorithm solvers with sample inputs and prints results to the terminal.

### Input Format Reference

| Algorithm | Input 1 | Input 2 |
|---|---|---|
| **0/1 Knapsack** | `weights \| capacity` e.g. `1, 2, 3 \| 5` | `values` e.g. `6, 10, 12` |
| **LCS** | String X e.g. `ABCBDAB` | String Y e.g. `BDCABA` |
| **Coin Change** | Denominations e.g. `1, 2, 5` | Target amount e.g. `11` |
| **MCM** | Dimensions e.g. `40, 20, 30, 10, 30` | *(not used)* |

```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Decoupled Backends**: All `core/` modules are pure Python with zero GUI dependency. They communicate with the frontend through a standardized dictionary contract.
- **Main-Thread Scheduling**: Animations use `self.after(delay_ms, callback)` — Tkinter's safe scheduling mechanism — to avoid multi-threading pitfalls while keeping the UI responsive.
- **Dual-Axis Scroll Grid**: A custom solution using a `tkinter.Canvas` embedding a `CTkFrame` grid viewport overcomes CustomTkinter's native single-axis scroll limitation.
- **Safety-Capped Benchmarks**: Recursive solvers are capped at `N ≤ 15` (or `N ≤ 12` for MCM) to prevent the UI thread from hanging on exponential growth.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

> This project was developed with the assistance of **AI coding tools**, specifically leveraging large language model capabilities for:
>
> - **Architecture design** — structuring the decoupled backend/frontend pattern and defining the standardized solver API contract.
> - **Algorithm implementation** — generating and verifying the three solver variants (Recursive, Tabular, Space-Optimized) and their traceback logic for each algorithm.
> - **GUI construction** — building the CustomTkinter layout, dual-axis scrolling widget, and Catppuccin Mocha theme system.
> - **Animation engine** — designing the non-blocking cell-by-cell step loop and heatmap interpolation gradient.
> - **Benchmarking framework** — developing the timing profiler with safe recursion limits and Matplotlib chart integration.
> - **Documentation** — generating the `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `TECHNICAL_README.md`, and `ALGORITHMS_AND_VISUALIZATION.md` reference documents.
>
> AI assistance was used as a pair-programming tool throughout development. All generated code was reviewed, tested, and integrated by the project author.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Identified areas for future improvement:

- [ ] **Top-Down Memoized Solvers** — Add recursive + cache variants to the benchmark comparison alongside pure recursive and tabular solvers.
- [ ] **Background Thread Benchmarking** — Move performance profiling off the main UI thread to eliminate potential stuttering on slower hardware.
- [ ] **Data Generation Utilities** — Implement `utils/data_gen.py` with standardized input generation helpers.
- [ ] **Visualizer Integration** — Unify `GUI/visualizer.py` with the main animation engine or deprecate it to keep the codebase clean.
- [ ] **Additional Algorithms** — Extend the toolkit with Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS), Edit Distance, and Rod Cutting problems.
- [ ] **Export Feature** — Allow users to export the DP table and benchmarking chart as PNG or CSV files.
